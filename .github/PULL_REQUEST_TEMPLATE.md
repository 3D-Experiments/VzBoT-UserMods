<!--
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the VzBot repository, it is
highly appreciated!

**Please make sure the submission conforms to the rules outlined below. PRs which fail
to conform to the rules below are likely to be rejected.**
-->

  * [ ] Create a subfolder with your name, and place the mods in a subfolder with
    a descriptive name within that folder, e.g.: `/maze/flux_capacitor`
  * [ ] Folders names MUST NOT contain spaces. If possible, make sure file names also 
    do not contain any spaces.
  * [ ] For each mod, add a small `README.md` file to its folder with a short description
    of what the mod accomplishes. This readme can be used to add pictures, give assembly
    instructions or specify a bill of materials if the mod requires additional hardware.
  * [ ] The PR modifies the top-level `README.md` of the category folder adding the 
    contribution to the table. Read the top part of the file for instructions on how
    to do this. Please preserve the alphabetical ordering while adding new rows.
  * [ ] The mod has been tested by the person submitting the mod 
    and/or other VzBot users. Make sure to add information about how the mod was tested below. 
  * [ ] Submitted STLs are printable without support. *(If the mod does not meet this criterion
    join the VzBot discord and ask the other users for advice on how to modify the mod such 
    that it does not require supports)*
  * [ ] Submitted STL files are not corrupt. *(This can be tested by opening the STL in PrusaSlicer or SuperSlicer
    and checking if mesh errors are reported.)*
  * [ ] Submitted STL files are oriented and scaled properly for printing.
  * [ ] Submitted slicer profiles contain no sensitive data (e.g. API keys).
